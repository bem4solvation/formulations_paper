# Towards optimal boundary integral formulations of the Poisson-Boltzmann equation for molecular electrostatics

Paper on PB formulations with a boundary element method. Collaboration between Stefan Search (USM), Elwin van't Wout (PUC), and Christopher Cooper (USM). Here you'll find:

* `tex`: Latex files for the manuscript
* `code_used`: Jupyter notebooks and python files to reproduce the results of the paper. These use the PBJ software: https://github.com/bem4solvation/pbj
* `example_notebooks`: Jupyter notebook examples for basic simple usage of the bem_electrostatics library
* `environment.yml`: Conda environment file which can be used to create an environment with bempp-cl, Exafmm and PBJ, plus some other dependencies.
