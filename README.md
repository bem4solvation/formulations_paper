# Towards optimal boundary integral formulations of the Poisson-Boltzmann equation for molecular electrostatics

Paper on PB formulations with a boundary element method. Collaboration between Stefan Search (USM), Elwin van't Wout (PUC), and Christopher Cooper (USM). Here you'll find:

* `tex`: Latex files for the manuscript
* `notebooks`: Jupyter notebooks to reproduce the results of the paper. These use the Poisson-Boltzmann & Jupyter (PBJ) software: https://github.com/bem4solvation/PBJ
